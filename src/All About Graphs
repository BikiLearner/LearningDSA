Type Of graph
    Directed : All the edges are directed
    UnDirected : All the edges are not directed

Cycle : start from a node and end at that node

Cyclic graph : graph with cycle
Acyclic Graph : graph with no cycle

Path : contain a lot of nodes and each of them are reachable
        A node cannot appear twice in a path

Degree of graph :
    Undirected graph : no of edges go inside or outside of that node
        Total degree = 2 * no of edges evey edges is associate with two nodes
    Directed Graph :
        In-degree : no of incoming edges
        Out-degree : no of outgoing edges

Edges weight : if the weight is not given the we will assume unit weight (1)

Adjacency Matrix : to store graph
