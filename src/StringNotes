# Strings are the type of objects that can store the character of values and in Java,
    every character is stored in 16 bits i,e using UTF 16-bit encoding

# To make Java more memory efficient (because no new objects are created
    if it exists already in the string constant pool).

# CharBuffer is part of the java.nio package, and it allows the manipulation of character
  buffers.It's primarily used to store and process sequences of characters
  in a mutable form.

# Classes that are implemented using the CharSequence interface are mentioned
  below and these provides much of functionality like substring,
  lastoccurence, first occurence, concatenate , toupper, tolower etc.
    String
    StringBuffer
    StringBuilder

# String : immutable mean one created cannot be change
            The functionality like toUpper toLower etc return a new object
            it does not modify the current object
            It is thread safe

# StringBuffer can be considered a peer class to String because both represent
  sequences of characters. However, unlike String, StringBuffer is mutable,
  meaning its content can be changed after creation.
  StringBuffer is synchronized, meaning multiple threads can safely modify
  the same StringBuffer object without corrupting the data.
  All mutating methods in StringBuffer are synchronized, ensuring that only one
  thread can modify the buffer at a time.
  performance Issue due to thread safety.

# StringBuilder in Java represents an alternative to String and StringBuffer Class,
  as it creates a mutable sequence of characters and it is not thread safe.
  It is used only within the thread , so there is no extra overhead ,
  so it is mainly used for single threaded program.
