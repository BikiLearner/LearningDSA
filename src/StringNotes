# Strings are the type of objects that can store the character of values and in Java,
    every character is stored in 16 bits i,e using UTF 16-bit encoding

# To make Java more memory efficient (because no new objects are created
    if it exists already in the string constant pool).

# CharBuffer is part of the java.nio package, and it allows the manipulation of character
  buffers.It's primarily used to store and process sequences of characters
  in a mutable form.

# Classes that are implemented using the CharSequence interface are mentioned
  below and these provides much of functionality like substring,
  lastoccurence, first occurence, concatenate , toupper, tolower etc.
    String
    StringBuffer
    StringBuilder

# String : immutable mean one created cannot be change
            The functionality like toUpper toLower etc return a new object
            it does not modify the current object
            It is thread safe

# StringBuffer can be considered a peer class to String because both represent
  sequences of characters. However, unlike String, StringBuffer is mutable,
  meaning its content can be changed after creation.
  StringBuffer is synchronized, meaning multiple threads can safely modify
  the same StringBuffer object without corrupting the data.
  All mutating methods in StringBuffer are synchronized, ensuring that only one
  thread can modify the buffer at a time.
  performance Issue due to thread safety.

# StringBuilder in Java represents an alternative to String and StringBuffer Class,
  as it creates a mutable sequence of characters and it is not thread safe.
  It is used only within the thread , so there is no extra overhead ,
  so it is mainly used for single threaded program.

# StringTokenizer class in Java is used to break a string into tokens.
  A StringTokenizer object in Java tokenizes a string by breaking it into smaller
  parts, called tokens, based on delimiters (e.g., spaces, commas).

# StringJoiner class in Java is a convenient utility for building a sequence of strings with delimiters,
  and optionally, a prefix and suffix. It simplifies the process compared to manually managing a
  delimiter using StringBuilder.

# If the string does not exist, then a new string instance is created and placed in a pool.
  If the string exists, then it will not create a new object. Rather, it will return the reference
  to the same instance. The cache that stores these string instances is known as the String Constant
  pool or String Pool.

  JDK 6 String pool was located inside PermGen(Permanent Generation) space.
  But in JDK 7 it is moved to the main heap area.

# if you want to store a dynamically created string to sting pool you can call intern() function
    ex: String d=new String("Bik");
        String demo=d.intern(); // this will then get inside string constant pool

# Why did the String pool move from PermGen to the normal heap area?
    PermGen space is limited, the default size is just 64 MB. it was a problem with creating and
    storing too many string objects in PermGen space. That’s why the String pool was moved to a
    larger heap area. To make Java more memory efficient
# String Class(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-class-in-java/?ref=next_article);

# StringBuffer s_buffer = new StringBuffer("Geeks");
# StringBuilder s_builder = new StringBuilder("Geeks");

# String Methods :
    str.length();
    str.charAt(3);
    str.substring(3);Return the substring from the ith  index character to end.
    str.substring(2, 5); Returns the substring from i to j-1 index.
    String output = s1.concat(s2); // concat two string
    s.indexOf(“Share”); Return first Occurrence if not present return -1 ;
    s.indexOf("ea",3);starting at the specified index. like index 3 it start search form index 3
    s.lastIndexOf("a");
    s1.equals(s2); // check equals
    s1.equalsIgnoreCase(s2); // ignore the case when checking
    s1.compareTo(s2); out < 0  // s1 comes before s2
                       out = 0  // s1 and s2 are equal.
                       out > 0   // s1 comes after s2.
    s1.compareToIgnoreCase(s2); same but ignore case
    word1.toLowerCase(); //make every character small letter
    word1.toUpperCase(); //make every character capital letter
    word1.trim(); remove leading and trailing white space
    str.replace(‘f’ ,’g’); replace character to another character
    s1.contains(s2) check the s2 is present in s1 or not
    s1.toCharArray(); change the string to character array
    s1.startsWith(s2) Return true if string starts with this prefix.

# StringBuffer class (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stringbuffer-class-in-java/?ref=next_article)
    if you need to perform multiple modifications to a string, using StringBuffer can be more
    efficient than regular String objects
    The string represents fixed-length, immutable character sequences
    while StringBuffer represents growable and writable character sequences.

    All Implemented Interfaces of StringBuffer class: Serializable, Appendable, CharSequence.
    public final class StringBuffer extends Object implements Serializable, CharSequence, Appendable.
    It inherits some of the methods from the Object class which such as
    clone(), equals(), finalize(), getClass(), hashCode(), notifies(), notifyAll().

    Important Constructors of StringBuffer class :
        StringBuffer(): creates an empty string buffer with an initial capacity of 16.
        StringBuffer(String str): creates a string buffer with the specified string.
        StringBuffer(int capacity): creates an empty string buffer with the specified capacity as length.

    Methods :
    insert() (Insert at a given position) : sb.insert(index, StringToInsert);
    replace() (replaces the given string from the specified i and j-1) : sb.replace(i, j-1, String);
    delete() (delete form index start to end-1 ) : sb.delete(1, 3);
    reverse() (reverse String) : sb.reverse();
    capacity() (Return the current capacity of Buffer
                if a no of character increase from its current capacity then =  ((oldCapacity * 2)+2))
                :sb.capacity()
    length() : Returns the length of the string.
    charAt()
    deleteCharAt()
    ensureCapacity() : Ensures capacity is at least equal to the given minimum.
    replace()

StringBuilder class (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stringbuilder-class-in-java-with-examples/?ref=next_article):
    StringBuilder class provides no guarantee of synchronization
    It is recommended to use were String will be used by single thread
    It is not safe for use by multiple thread
    String Builder is not thread-safe and high in performance compared to String buffer.

# StringTokenizer Class (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stringtokenizer-class-in-java/?ref=next_article)
    A StringTokenizer is a class or function used to break a string into smaller components,
    known as tokens. A token is typically a substring that is separated by specific delimiters
    (e.g., spaces, commas, or other characters).
    Tokenization is the first step in the parsing process. In compilers and interpreters,
    this step is often called lexical analysis or scanning

    Constructors of StringToken :
        StringTokenizer(String str) : Default delimiters like newline, space, tab, carriage return, and form feed.
        StringTokenizer(String str, String delimiters) : delimiters is a set of delimiters that are used to
                                                         tokenize the given string.
        StringTokenizer(String str, String delimiters, boolean flag) : The first two parameters have the
                                                                        same meaning wherein The flag serves the following purpose.
        If the flag is false, delimiter characters serve to separate tokens
        If the flag is true, delimiter characters are considered to be tokens.

    Methods Of StringTokenizer Class :
        countTokens() : Returns the total number of tokens present
        hasMoreTokens() : Tests if tokens are present for the StringTokenizer’s string
        nextElement() : Returns an Object rather than String
        hasMoreElements() : Returns the same value as hasMoreToken
            This method returns the same value as hasMoreToken.
            It exists so that the class can implement the Enumeration interface.
        nextToken() : Returns the next token from the given StringTokenizer.
