# Rate at which the time taken Increases with respect to Input size is Known
as Time complexity

# Three rules for time complexity
    1) TC, worst case scenario
    2) Avoid constants
    3) avoid lower values
# Big-oh O()(Higher bound), Theta , Omega (Lower Bound)

# Space complexity : Auxiliary space (The space u take to solve the problem)
                    + Input space (Space that u take to store the problem)

# 10^8 roughly takes 1 second
